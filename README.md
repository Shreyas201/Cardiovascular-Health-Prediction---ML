# Cardiovascular Health Prediction using Machine Learning

### Overview
Utilizing clinical record data to assess the likelihood of heart failure occurrence in patients. The dataset encompasses comprehensive health information of individuals with heart disease, incorporating factors such as age, gender, smoking status, serum sodium levels, ejection fraction, creatinine phosphokinase levels, and follow-up duration. The project is segmented into two distinct phases: the initial phase involves crucial data preparation procedures, while the subsequent phase entails the development of a machine learning model using unsupervised learning techniques to identify patients at elevated risk of heart failure-related mortality.

### Findings
The heart failure dataset analysis yielded significant insights. Key predictors include age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and sodium levels. Patients with hypertension, diabetes, or anaemia face heightened risks, with men and smokers, particularly susceptible. Lifestyle modifications and early identification are crucial for prevention. Healthcare providers should prioritize risk factor monitoring to reduce heart failure occurrence and related mortality.
