# Overview
Using clinical record data to predict the probability of heart failure in a patient. The data used has details of the health problems of heart disease patients and includes features such as age, gender, smoking habits, serum sodium level, ejection fraction, creatinine phosphokinase levels, and follow-up time length. The project is divided into two phases. During the first phase, we performed several important data prepartion steps. And during the second phase, we developed a ML model using unsupervised learning that predicts which patients are at a higher risk of death due to heart failure.
